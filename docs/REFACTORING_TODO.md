# Refactoring TODO

This file tracks remaining refactoring opportunities for the DiaBloS codebase.

## Priority 1: Delegate More Helper Methods to Engine (Low Risk)

✅ **COMPLETED** - All Priority 1 methods have been delegated to SimulationEngine.

## Priority 2: Extract Plotting to Separate Module (Medium Risk)

✅ **COMPLETED** - Plotting logic extracted to `lib/plotting/scope_plotter.py`.

## Priority 3: Extract Run History to Separate Module (Low Risk)

✅ **COMPLETED** - Run history logic extracted to `lib/services/run_history_service.py`.

## Priority 4: Extract execution_init Loops (Medium-High Risk)

✅ **COMPLETED** - `execution_init` logic extracted to `engine.initialize_execution()`.


## Priority 5: Extract Canvas Tools and Rendering

✅ **COMPLETED** - All rendering and analysis logic extracted from `modern_canvas.py`, `block.py`, and `connection.py`.

## Priority 6: Simplify Modern Canvas (Logic Extraction)

✅ **COMPLETED** - Logic extracted to `InteractionManager`, `HistoryManager`, `SelectionManager`, `MenuManager`.

## Priority 7: Simplify Main Window

✅ **COMPLETED** - Logic extracted to `MenuBuilder`, `ProjectManager`.

## Completed ✅

- [x] Delegate `set_block_type()` to engine
- [x] Delegate `identify_memory_blocks()` to engine
- [x] Delegate `count_rk45_ints()` to engine
- [x] Fix and delegate `reset_execution_data()` to engine
- [x] Refactor `execution_loop` to use `engine.execute_block()`
- [x] Refactor `execution_loop` to use `engine.propagate_outputs()`
- [x] Code cleanup (indentation, duplicate logic)
- [x] Delegate `update_global_list()` to engine
- [x] Delegate `count_computed_global_list()` to engine
- [x] Delegate `get_max_hierarchy()` to engine
- [x] Delegate `detect_algebraic_loops()` to engine (40 lines → 3 lines)
- [x] Delegate `children_recognition()` to engine
- [x] Delegate `reset_memblocks()` to engine
- [x] Extract plotting logic to `lib/plotting/scope_plotter.py`
- [x] Extract run history logic to `lib/services/run_history_service.py`
- [x] Extract execution init logic to `engine.initialize_execution()`
- [x] Improvements: Dynamic height scaling for blocks based on port count (fixes SumBlock size)
- [x] Refactor ModernCanvas: Logic extracted to `InteractionManager` (mouse events, state machine)
- [x] Refactor ModernCanvas: Logic extracted to `HistoryManager`, `SelectionManager`, `MenuManager`.
- [x] Refactor MainWindow: Logic extracted to `MenuBuilder`, `ProjectManager`.
- [x] Fix: Implemented missing `Undo` and `Redo` actions
- [x] Fix: Implemented `Recent Files` loading logic
- [x] Testing: Added unit tests for `InteractionManager`, `SelectionManager`.
- [x] Refactor: Optimized `SystemCompiler` with closure-based executors (Fast Solver Speedup).
- [x] Fix: Rectangle selection bug after double-click block creation (`modern_canvas.py`)

## New Refactoring Opportunities (Identified Jan 2026)

### Priority 1: Quick Wins (Low Risk) - COMPLETED

| Task | Files | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Remove unused imports | 50 files | ✅ 143 imports removed |
| Delete duplicate imports | ~8 files | ✅ Fixed by ruff |
| Replace `except: pass` with specific handling | lib/lib.py, flattener.py, project_manager.py | ✅ 7 fixes |
| Move orphaned test files to tests/ | 4 files at root | ✅ Moved to tests/ and tools/ |

### Priority 2: Split Monolithic Files (Medium Effort) - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

| Task | Status | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Clean up `modern_canvas.py` | ✅ | 2,323 → 2,267 lines, fixed duplicate keyPressEvent |
| Extract `SubsystemManager` from lib.py | ✅ | Extracted to `lib/managers/subsystem_manager.py` (Phase 3) |
| Clean up `main_window.py` | ✅ | 1,609 → 1,518 lines, removed duplicate methods |

### Priority 3: Consolidate Patterns (Higher Effort) - MOSTLY COMPLETED

| Task | Status | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Create `StateSpaceBaseBlock` | ✅ | New base class, 4 blocks refactored, ~70 lines saved |
| Standardize block error returns | ✅ | All blocks return `{0: value, 'E': False}` or `{'E': True, 'error': msg}` (Phase 2) |
| Fix circular imports (theme_manager) | ✅ | Lazy import in menu_block.py |

### Remaining Tasks

- [x] Extract `SubsystemManager` from lib.py — Done (Phase 3)
- [x] Standardize block error returns across all blocks — Done (Phase 2)
- [ ] Further split modern_canvas.py into multiple files (optional)
